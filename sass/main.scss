//1: Abstracts (or utilities): holds Sass tools, helper files, variables, functions, mixins and other config files. These files are meant to be just helpers which don’t output any CSS when compiled.

@import "1-abstracts/variables";
@import "1-abstracts/mixins";
@import "1-abstracts/functions";

//2: Base: holds the boilerplate code for the project. Including standard styles such as resets and typographic rules, which are commonly used throughout your project.

@import "2-base/normalize";
@import "2-base/typography";

//3: Components (or modules): holds all of your styles for buttons, carousels, sliders, and similar page components (think widgets). Your project will typically contain a lot of component files — as the whole site/app should be mostly composed of small modules.

@import "3-components/buttons";
@import "3-components/links";

//4: Layout: contains all styles involved with the layout of your project. Such as styles for your header, footer, navigation and the grid system.
@import "4-layout/feature";
@import "4-layout/footer";
@import "4-layout/hero";
@import "4-layout/input";
@import "4-layout/navigation";
@import "4-layout/ouput";
@import "4-layout/signup";
